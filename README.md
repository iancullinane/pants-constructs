project-zomboid-construct
=========================

This will provide a project zomboid server runnning on EC2. Server configs will be generated at synth. If you provide a file under `assets/mods.txt` you can use a space seperated Modname:ModID format to list server mods. See the current mod list in this repo. This way they will be downloaded and managed at server start.  

It is assumed you have a VPC and HostedZone to hook into. 

The stack will provide the following:

* The four needed config files, and a systemd unit file
  * Generated by template (coming soon, more config)
* MultiPartUserData
  * Install system dependencies
  * Install game via steamcmd
  * Create cdk assets from the files generated at synth
    * Add file commands (including unzip of main files) to UserData
  * Write, enable, and start a systemd unit file on `start-server.sh`
* A subdomain on the provided HostedZone (server name is your domain name, without a ".com")
* Steam ingress rules
* If provided, IP address whitelisting for a set of users (required until NLB is finished)
* An EC2 instance using all above

***Note***: As of this commit access is provided by IP address ingress rules. This will remain until I finish the networking portion.

### Config Props

Requires config interfaces for the infrastructue and game itself:

---
```markdown
export interface InfraConfig {
  region: string,
  keyName: string;
  role: iam.IRole,
  subdomain?: string,
  vpc: ec2.IVpc,
  sg: ec2.ISecurityGroup,
  hz: r53.IHostedZone,
  vol: ec2.IVolume,
  instancetype?: string,
}

export interface GameConfig {
  distdir: string,
  servername?: string,
  modFile?: Buffer,
  public?: Boolean;
  fresh?: boolean,
}
```

### modFile

You can provide a list of mods. Place a file called `mods.txt` in `assets/` to load it. Otherwise the below modlist will be used. This file must be in a certain format (below) to be properly parsed. Currently this pacakge has the following `mods.txt` file embedded. If you want to change it. Mods are included in ther `server.ini` file:
